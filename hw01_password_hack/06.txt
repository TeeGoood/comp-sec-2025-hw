Question:

You have to store a password in a database. Please explain your
design/strategy for securely storing it.
(Hints: Proper hash function, Salting, Cost factor, Database Security)

Answer:

- only store the hash of password and using Bcrypt algorithm as a hash function 
- use random salt for each password so if hacker use ranbow table method they must have very large table
- use reasonably high cost factor for hashing, reasonably mean considering trading it off with performance
- encrypt the database
